# Understanding TypeScript Course Resources

This repository contains attachments, slides and code snapshots for my course [Understanding TypeScript](https://acad.link/typescript).

If you're facing any issues with the code, please post in the course Q&A section.

# Repository Content

- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.
- **Lecture Attachments:** Any standalone code files or other attachments that are mentioned in course lectures (and attached to those lectures) are stored in the [/attachments](/attachments/) folder.
- **Other Resources:** Other resources (like the course slides) can be found in the [/other](/other/) folder.

The **Code Snapshots** and **Lecture Attachments** folders contain one subfolder per course section - this allows you to easily access the resources for a specific course section.

# How To Use Code Snapshots

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine.

# Sample projects
There are four sample projects 
- **The Google maps** one is in prj-libs-follow/prj-libs-03-fetching-coordinates, it was built with web-pack and can be started by running npm start
